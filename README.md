# Drift Unreal Plugin

This plugin offers a quick and convenient way for you to integrating Drift into your Unreal Engine 4 based
game. It offers both a complete UE4 friendly C++ API, and convenient blueprint access to basic features.
There's also an OnlineSubsystem implementation, but it still doesn't cover all the features.

## Installation

Copy the Plugins folder to your games project, compile the editor, and enable the Drift plugins you want.
You'll need to enable at least Drift, and DriftEditor. For Steam and Oculus authentication support, you
also need to enable DriftSteam, and DriftOculus.

Copy the ErrorReporter module to your Source folder. This module is not part of the plugin as it's also
useful on its own, and must expose headers, and some default implementations. Prefereably this would be
part of the engine, but it's not.

Open the Project Settings pane and go to the Pugins/Drift section. Enter the relevant data there.

Somehwere during startup, you'll want to authenticate the player. In the editor and by default it'll
use automatically created users and passwords that are stored on the local computer. This is currently
only secure for iOS, where it uses the KeyChain. Secure implementations for Windows and other platforms
will come later.

The editor supports multiple PIE sessions, which will all get their own user/password combination.

```
void MyClass::Login()
{
	// Get an instance of the drift API.
	if (auto drift = FDriftWorldHelper(GetWorld()).GetInstance())
	{
		// Register a callback for handling when the player login is complete
		drift->OnPlayerAuthenticated().AddUObject(this, &MyClass::HandlePlayerAuthenticated);
		// Begin authentication
		drift->AuthenticatePlayer();
	}
}

void MyClass::HandlePlayerAuthenticated(bool success, const FPlayerAuthenticatedInfo& info)
{
	if (success)
	{
		// Show player UI, load a new level, or whatever you need
	}
	else
	{
		// Something went wrong, details are in `info.error`
		UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("Failed to log on: %s"), *info.error);
	}
}
```

## User Sessions

## Error Handling

Once a session has been established, the things that can tear down the session are:
* The network connection goes down.
* The client fails to heartbeat within the session timeout limit. Hearbeats are handled by the plugin,
  you don't need to do anything.
* The user signs in to the same game using a second client, in which case the session is usurped, and
  no further calls from the initial client will be accepted.
* The user calls disconnect.
* The API key or key/version combination is being revoked on the server.
* Generally, failure to complete other operations don't cause a disconnect, and if the game handles the
  errors appropriately, the calls can be retried later.

Any other errors, occuring from calling non authentication endpoints will generate the appropriate error
callbacks, but won't tear down the session. It's up to each game to decide how to deal with each type
of error.

# Usage

## Dedicated Server

When using the `OnlineSubsystemDrift`, override `RegisterServer` in your `GameSession` class and call `CreateSession`
with the relevant paramters to advertise the game session. You'll need to override `GetGameSessionClass` in your
custom `GameMode` class to return the new `GameSession` class.
To simplify the remaining game logic, it's often convenient to implement the login and session registration in
an empty "Login" map, which loads the real game map after successfully registering the session.
